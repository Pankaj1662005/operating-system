A mini-project for Operating Systems developed during 2nd year at Thapar University. This simple shell script simulates an ATM transaction system allowing users to perform basic banking operations like deposit, withdrawal, and balance check.

## üìå Project Overview

This project simulates an ATM where a user can:
- Withdraw money (if sufficient balance)
- Deposit money
- Check current balance

Initial balance is set to ‚Çπ5000. The script runs in an infinite loop until manually exited (`Ctrl + C`).
